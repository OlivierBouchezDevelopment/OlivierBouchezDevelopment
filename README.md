👋 Hi there! I'm a seasoned software architect with over 30 years of experience in the realm of data management. My journey in technology began at the University of Namur, where I pursued a Bachelor's in Economics and a Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering from 1988 to 1993.

🔍 My professional career took off as a software developer focusing on C/C++ on Windows, where I played a pivotal role in developing a document management system. This was back in 1993, a time when web pages and search engines were just starting to make their mark. My work primarily revolved around enhancing document structure, search functionality, and linking mechanisms.

🌐 In 1996, I transitioned to working as a software developer in Unix environments (Sun Systems) at a data-centric company. For two decades, my focus was on crafting data quality software and ETL components. Even if C/C++ is a great language, along my career I also worked with Perl, embracing its versatility and text processing capabilities.

🐍 Since 2017, I've been working with Python and have grown to love the language and its community. Python's simplicity and the robust ecosystem have made it an invaluable tool in my toolkit. Through this GitHub account, I aim to contribute my share to the community and the field of software development, sharing projects and insights that span my extensive experience.

Over the years, I've climbed every rung of the corporate ladder, evolving from a developer to a project manager, team manager, department director, and now serve as the European Data Manager. Despite my ascent, I found that I missed the hands-on joy of software development. This GitHub account is my playground – a space where I can share my wealth of knowledge and indulge in the pleasure of coding, away from my primary responsibilities.

Here, you'll find projects that reflect my expertise and passion for creating impactful software solutions. I'm excited to collaborate, learn from the vibrant GitHub community, and keep my coding skills sharp. Let's innovate together!
